# Performance Management Guide - Acme Corporation

## Introduction

The goal of performance management at Acme Corporation is to create a fair, transparent, and growth-oriented system that aligns individual contributions with company objectives. We focus on **continuous feedback**, **clear expectations**, and **coaching**, not just annual ratings.

This guide explains how goals are set, how feedback is shared, how performance is evaluated, and how compensation and development decisions are made.

## Performance Cycle Overview

Acme follows an annual performance cycle with structured checkpoints:

1. **January–February**: Goal setting and alignment
2. **March–September**: Ongoing check-ins and feedback
3. **October**: Formal mid-year review (for some roles)
4. **November–December**: Annual performance review and calibration
5. **January (following year)**: Compensation and promotion decisions communicated

## Roles and Responsibilities

### Employees

Employees are expected to:
- Understand their goals and how they support team and company strategy
- Request and act on feedback regularly
- Document key achievements and challenges throughout the year
- Participate actively in check-ins and performance conversations

### Managers

Managers are expected to:
- Translate company and department strategy into clear, measurable goals
- Provide timely, specific feedback (both positive and constructive)
- Remove obstacles and support employee development
- Conduct fair, unbiased performance assessments
- Document performance accurately in the HR system

### HR

HR is responsible for:
- Designing and maintaining the performance framework
- Training managers and employees on the process
- Monitoring fairness and consistency across teams
- Supporting performance improvement plans when needed

## Goal Setting

### Principles of Good Goals

All goals should be:
- **Aligned**: Connected to team and company objectives
- **Measurable**: Have clear success criteria
- **Time-Bound**: Include deadlines or review dates
- **Realistic**: Ambitious but achievable with available resources
- **Documented**: Entered into the HR Performance Portal

### Types of Goals

We use three main categories of goals:

1. **Business/Results Goals**
   - Directly tied to metrics (revenue, uptime, tickets resolved, etc.)
   - Example: "Increase customer satisfaction (CSAT) from 4.1 to 4.5 by Q4."

2. **Capability/Skill Goals**
   - Focus on developing new skills or deepening expertise
   - Example: "Complete advanced Python course and apply to automate at least 2 manual reports by Q3."

3. **Behavioral/Values Goals**
   - Reflect how work is done (collaboration, ownership, customer focus)
   - Example: "Facilitate at least 3 cross-functional retrospectives to improve collaboration with Support."

### Goal Setting Process

1. Company announces annual strategic priorities at the beginning of the year.
2. Departments translate these into team-level objectives.
3. Managers and employees co-create individual goals in 1:1 conversations.
4. Employees enter goals into the HR Performance Portal.
5. Managers review and approve goals by the published deadline.

## Check-Ins and Ongoing Feedback

### One-on-One Meetings

Managers should hold **weekly or bi-weekly 1:1s** focused on:
- Current priorities and progress toward goals
- Roadblocks and resource needs
- Feedback in both directions
- Career development and well-being

### Feedback Guidelines

Effective feedback should be:
- **Timely**: Given as close as possible to the event
- **Specific**: Focused on observable behaviors, not personality
- **Balanced**: Includes strengths and areas for growth
- **Actionable**: Offers clear next steps or suggestions

Example feedback structure:
- **Situation**: "In yesterday's client demo..."
- **Behavior**: "You skipped the security slide that the client had specifically asked about."
- **Impact**: "This created additional follow-up questions and reduced their confidence."
- **Next Step**: "Next time, let's review the agenda together beforehand and ensure all client requests are covered."

### 360-Degree Feedback (Optional)

Some teams use 360 feedback for development purposes:
- Feedback collected from peers, cross-functional partners, and direct reports
- Focused on strengths and development areas
- Shared with the employee and used for coaching, not directly for ratings

## Mid-Year Review

### Purpose

The mid-year review is a formal checkpoint to:
- Revisit and adjust goals based on changing priorities
- Document progress and accomplishments
- Identify support needed for the second half of the year

### Process

1. Employee completes a brief self-review focused on achievements and challenges.
2. Manager adds comments, updates goal status, and proposes adjustments.
3. Manager and employee meet to discuss the review and agree on next steps.
4. Finalized mid-year review is stored in the HR Performance Portal.

## Annual Performance Review

### Rating Scale

Acme uses a 5-point performance rating scale:

1. **Far Exceeds Expectations**
2. **Exceeds Expectations**
3. **Meets Expectations**
4. **Partially Meets Expectations**
5. **Does Not Meet Expectations**

Descriptions and examples for each rating are available in the HR Portal.

### Inputs to the Annual Review

The annual review is based on multiple inputs:
- Goal achievement (business, capability, and behavioral goals)
- Feedback from stakeholders
- Demonstration of company values
- Performance over the entire year, not just recent months

### Self-Review

Employees complete a self-review that includes:
- Summary of major accomplishments
- Examples of how goals were met or exceeded
- Challenges faced and how they were addressed
- Reflection on values and behaviors
- Development areas and career interests

### Manager Review

Managers then:
- Review the self-assessment and supporting data
- Gather additional input from relevant stakeholders
- Draft performance summary and proposed rating
- Provide specific examples supporting the rating

### Calibration

To ensure fairness and consistency:
- Managers participate in **calibration meetings** with HR and peer managers
- Ratings are compared across teams and adjusted if needed
- HR monitors distributions and potential bias patterns

## Performance Improvement

### When Performance Concerns Arise

If an employee is **consistently not meeting expectations**, managers should:

1. Provide clear, specific feedback about the issue
2. Document prior conversations and expectations
3. Involve HR early to discuss options

### Performance Improvement Plan (PIP)

A Performance Improvement Plan may be used when:
- Performance issues are significant and ongoing
- Expectations and support need to be formalized

Typical PIP characteristics:
- Duration: 30–90 days
- Clear, measurable performance expectations
- Regular check-ins (weekly or more frequent)
- Documented outcomes at the end of the period

A PIP is intended to support improvement, not to be punitive. However, failure to meet PIP expectations may result in reassignment or termination.

## Promotions and Career Development

### Promotion Principles

Promotions are based on:
- Demonstrated ability to operate consistently at the next level
- Sustained performance over time (typically 12+ months)
- Business need and available roles
- Alignment with role expectations and leveling guidelines

### Promotion Process

1. Employee and manager discuss readiness and interest.
2. Manager collects evidence of performance at the next level.
3. Manager submits promotion case to the promotion committee.
4. Committee reviews cases across teams for consistency.
5. Approved promotions are communicated, usually in Q1 or Q3.

### Development Planning

Development is not limited to promotions. Options include:
- Stretch assignments and special projects
- Mentorship programs
- Internal job rotations
- Formal training and certifications

Employees should create a **development plan** with their manager that includes:
- Long-term career aspirations
- Skills to develop
- Specific actions and timelines

## Documentation and Systems

### HR Performance Portal

All formal performance information is stored in the HR Performance Portal, including:
- Goals and status updates
- Feedback notes (when documented)
- Mid-year and annual reviews
- Performance ratings
- PIP documentation (if applicable)

### Manager Responsibilities

Managers should keep documentation:
- Objective and factual
- Free of discriminatory language
- Focused on behaviors and outcomes

Employees may request access to their own performance records via HR.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How often should performance be discussed?

At minimum, performance should be discussed:
- During goal setting
- At mid-year review
- At annual review

However, **ongoing conversations** (weekly or bi-weekly) are strongly encouraged.

### Can I dispute my performance rating?

Employees who disagree with their rating should:
1. Discuss concerns with their manager first.
2. If unresolved, request a meeting including HR.
3. Provide specific examples or data supporting their perspective.

HR will review the case and determine if any adjustments or additional reviews are warranted.

### How does performance affect bonuses and raises?

While business performance and budget constraints play a role, in general:
- Higher ratings are associated with larger merit increases and bonus multiples.
- Employees rated "Does Not Meet Expectations" are typically not eligible for bonuses or raises.

Specific compensation guidelines are published annually by HR.

### Are performance conversations confidential?

Performance information is shared on a need-to-know basis:
- Employee and their direct manager
- Next-level managers (as appropriate)
- HR Business Partners
- Senior leaders involved in calibration

### What if I change roles mid-year?

If you change roles:
- Your previous manager will provide input on your performance in the earlier role.
- Your current manager will evaluate your performance in the new role.
- Both inputs may be combined for the annual review.
