# Remote Work and Flexible Work Policy - Acme Corporation

## Purpose

This policy defines expectations and guidelines for remote work and flexible work arrangements at Acme Corporation. Our goal is to provide flexibility while maintaining productivity, collaboration, and security.

## Eligibility

### Roles Eligible for Remote Work

Roles that may be eligible for partial or full remote work include:
- Software engineering and product roles
- Customer support and success (with coverage requirements)
- Marketing, design, and analytics roles
- Certain finance, HR, and operations roles

Some roles require on-site presence (e.g., facilities, on-site IT support). Eligibility is determined by role requirements and manager approval.

### Employee Requirements

To be approved for remote work, employees must:
- Successfully complete the 90-day onboarding/probation period
- Demonstrate strong performance and reliable communication
- Have a suitable, safe, and secure workspace at home

## Types of Arrangements

### Hybrid Work

Most roles follow a **hybrid work model**:
- Up to 2 remote days per week (standard)
- On-site presence on core collaboration days defined by the team
- Exceptions may be approved for specific business needs

### Fully Remote

Some roles may be designated as fully remote:
- Employees are not required to be near an office
- Occasional travel for team events or all-hands may be required

### Temporary Remote Work

Temporary remote arrangements (e.g., travel, personal reasons) may be approved for a limited time period. Employees must:
- Obtain manager approval in advance
- Coordinate with HR if working from another country

## Expectations for Remote Work

### Work Hours and Availability

- Employees must be available during their agreed **core hours** (typically 10:00 AM–3:00 PM local time)
- Total weekly working hours remain the same as on-site employees
- Calendar status (e.g., "Focus Time," "In a Meeting") should be kept up to date
- Slack or primary communication tools should be monitored during work hours

### Communication

Remote employees are expected to:
- Keep cameras on during most 1:1s and small team meetings (bandwidth and accessibility exceptions allowed)
- Respond to messages within a reasonable time (e.g., within 2 business hours for non-urgent items)
- Use status messages to indicate availability (e.g., "Heads down on feature X")

### Collaboration

To support collaboration:
- Key meetings should be scheduled within overlapping working hours
- Documentation (e.g., meeting notes, decisions) should be kept in Confluence or shared drives
- Hybrid meetings should use conference room audio/video so remote participants can contribute equally

## Equipment and Expenses

### Company-Provided Equipment

Acme provides necessary equipment for remote work, including:
- Laptop and charger
- External monitor (where applicable)
- Keyboard and mouse
- Headset

Additional equipment may be approved by the manager and IT.

### Home Office Expenses

Acme may reimburse some home office expenses:
- One-time stipend for desk, chair, or monitor
- Monthly stipend for internet costs in certain regions

See the **Home Office Reimbursement Policy** for specific limits and processes.

## Security and Data Protection

Remote employees must follow all IT security policies, including:
- Using company-managed devices for work
- Connecting to the corporate VPN when accessing internal systems
- Storing company data only in approved locations (no personal devices or drives)
- Locking screens when away from their workstation

Public Wi-Fi should be avoided where possible. If used, VPN is mandatory.

## Performance and Monitoring

### Performance Standards

Performance expectations for remote employees are the same as for on-site employees:
- Meeting goals and deadlines
- Maintaining quality of work
- Contributing to team objectives

### Visibility of Work

To maintain visibility and trust:
- Use task-tracking tools (e.g., Jira, Asana) to document work
- Share progress updates in team channels or stand-ups
- Keep calendars current with working hours and meetings

Acme does **not** use invasive monitoring tools (e.g., keystroke logging). We focus on outcomes, not surveillance.

## Health, Safety, and Ergonomics

Employees working remotely must:
- Maintain a safe workspace free of hazards
- Use ergonomic setups where possible
- Take regular breaks to avoid fatigue

HR and Facilities may provide guidance on ergonomic best practices.

## Remote Work from Another Region or Country

### Domestic Relocation

Employees who wish to work from another state or region must:
- Obtain approval from their manager and HR
- Confirm whether Acme is registered to employ staff in that location
- Understand any changes to tax or benefits

### International Remote Work

Working from another country, even temporarily, can create legal and tax implications. Employees must **not** work from another country for more than a few days without:
- Written approval from HR and Legal
- Confirmation of any visa or work permit requirements

## Requesting a Remote or Flexible Arrangement

### Process

1. Discuss interest in remote or flexible work with your manager.
2. If aligned, submit a request via the HR Portal.
3. Manager and HR review the request, considering:
   - Role requirements
   - Team needs and coverage
   - Performance history
4. Decision is communicated in writing.

### Trial Period

Remote arrangements may start with a trial period (e.g., 3 months) to evaluate effectiveness. Adjustments can be made based on feedback.

## Revoking or Changing Arrangements

Remote or flexible arrangements may be modified or revoked if:
- Performance concerns arise
- Business or team needs change
- Security, compliance, or legal issues are identified

Where possible, Acme will provide advance notice and discuss alternatives.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I work remotely full-time if my role is currently hybrid?**
A: It depends on role requirements and business needs. Discuss with your manager and HR.

A: No, but you must work your contracted hours, be available during core hours, and coordinate schedules with your team.

**Q: Will remote work affect my opportunities for promotion?**
