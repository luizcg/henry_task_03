# Travel and Expense Policy - Acme Corporation

## Purpose

This policy defines which business expenses are reimbursable, how to book travel, and the process for submitting and approving expense reports. The goal is to support necessary business travel while managing costs responsibly.

## General Principles

- Spend company money as carefully as you would your own.
- Choose cost-effective options that still allow you to be safe and productive.
- Obtain approvals in advance when required.
- Provide complete, accurate receipts and documentation.

## Pre-Approval Requirements

The following require written pre-approval from your manager:
- Any international travel
- Domestic trips exceeding 5 nights
- Conference attendance over $2,000 total cost
- Business-class flights (for eligible roles/routes only)

## Booking Travel

### Preferred Booking Tools

Employees must book flights, hotels, and rental cars through the approved Travel Portal:
- **Travel Portal**: travel.acme-corp.com
- **Support**: travel-support@acme-corp.com

Using the portal ensures negotiated rates, duty-of-care tracking, and consolidated reporting.

### Air Travel Guidelines

- Book **economy class** for flights under 6 hours.
- Business class may be approved for:
  - Flights over 8 hours of continuous air time, or
  - Senior leadership roles (VP and above) where justified.
- Choose the lowest logical fare within 2 hours of preferred departure time.
- Avoid unnecessary change fees by booking only once dates are confirmed.

### Hotel Guidelines

- Book standard rooms at mid-range hotels.
- Preferred nightly rate limits (before tax):
  - $200/night in standard cities
  - $275/night in high-cost cities (see HR Portal list)
- Use corporate-negotiated hotels where available.
- Do not book suites unless required for business reasons and approved in advance.

### Ground Transportation

Acceptable options include:
- Public transportation (preferred when safe and practical)
- Rideshare services (Uber, Lyft) or taxis
- Rental cars when necessary, compact or mid-size category

Employees must:
- Decline collision damage waivers if covered by Acme’s insurance (see Travel Portal)
- Follow local traffic laws and avoid distracted driving

## Meals and Per Diem

### Meal Limits

Meal expenses should be reasonable and within daily guidelines:
- Breakfast: up to $20
- Lunch: up to $25
- Dinner: up to $40

These are guidelines, not automatic entitlements. Higher costs may be justified in certain cities or situations; document reasons in the expense report.

### Alcohol

- Moderate alcohol with dinner is permissible (up to 2 drinks).
- Alcohol is **not** reimbursable when purchased without a meal or in excessive quantities.

### Group Meals

For team or client meals:
- The most senior Acme employee present should pay and submit the expense.
- List all attendees and their companies (for clients/vendors).
- Clearly note the business purpose (e.g., "Project kickoff dinner").

## Non-Reimbursable Expenses

The following are **not** reimbursable:
- Personal entertainment (movies, in-room Pay-Per-View, streaming services)
- Mini-bar charges
- Fines (parking tickets, traffic violations)
- Luxury upgrades (first-class flights, premium hotel suites) without prior approval
- Personal travel days unrelated to business
- Family member expenses
- Memberships (airline clubs, gyms) unless explicitly approved

## Combining Business and Personal Travel

Employees may add personal days to a business trip, provided that:
- The primary purpose of travel is business.
- Personal travel costs (extra nights, detours) are paid by the employee.
- The cost to Acme is not higher than business-only travel.

Document the cost comparison (e.g., screenshot from the Travel Portal) in the expense report.

## Expense Report Submission

### Timing

- Submit expense reports **within 14 days** of completing travel.
- Non-travel expenses (e.g., office supplies, local mileage) should be submitted monthly.

### Required Documentation

For each expense:
- Itemized receipt showing vendor, date, items, and total
- Proof of payment (credit card slip, bank statement, or receipt showing "paid")
- Business purpose (who, what, why)

Missing receipts may require a signed Missing Receipt Affidavit and additional manager approval.

### Currency and Exchange Rates

- Submit expenses in the currency charged.
- The expense system will convert using daily market rates.
- Do not manually adjust exchange rates unless correcting a clear error.

## Local (Non-Travel) Expenses

### Local Transportation

- Reimbursable: public transit, rideshare, or mileage for personal car when visiting clients or other offices.
- Mileage reimbursement rate follows IRS guidelines (see HR Portal for current rate).
- Normal commuting between home and primary office is **not** reimbursable.

### Office Supplies and Equipment

- Use central purchasing or approved vendors whenever possible.
- Small incidental purchases (under $100) may be expensed with manager approval.
- Larger items require pre-approval and should follow Procurement Policy.

## Approvals and Audit

### Manager Responsibilities

Approving managers must:
- Review expenses for reasonableness and compliance
- Ensure receipts and documentation are complete
- Return reports to employees for correction if needed

### Audit and Compliance

Finance may:
- Conduct random or targeted audits of expense reports
- Request additional documentation
- Deny reimbursement for non-compliant items

Repeated or serious violations of this policy may result in disciplinary action.

## Travel Safety and Emergencies

Employees must:
- Follow local laws and safety guidelines
- Register travel in the Travel Portal so Acme can assist in emergencies
- Contact the Travel Assistance Hotline for medical or security incidents

**Travel Assistance Hotline** information is available in the Travel Portal and in your booking confirmation emails.
