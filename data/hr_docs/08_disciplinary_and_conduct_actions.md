# Disciplinary and Conduct Actions Policy - Acme Corporation

## Purpose

This policy outlines how Acme Corporation addresses misconduct, performance issues, and violations of company policies. Our goal is to correct issues fairly and consistently while maintaining a safe, respectful, and productive workplace.

## Guiding Principles

- **Fairness**: Similar situations are treated consistently.
- **Progressive Discipline**: When appropriate, we use escalating steps rather than immediate termination.
- **Documentation**: Key conversations and decisions are documented.
- **Respect**: Employees are treated with dignity throughout the process.

## Scope

This policy applies to all employees, regardless of role or seniority. Contractors and temporary workers may be subject to similar processes through their agencies.

## Types of Issues

### Performance Issues

Performance issues include:
- Not meeting role expectations or goals
- Repeated missed deadlines
- Poor quality of work
- Inadequate collaboration or communication

### Conduct Issues

Conduct issues include:
- Violations of the Code of Conduct
- Disrespectful or unprofessional behavior
- Attendance problems (chronic lateness, unexcused absences)
- Misuse of company assets

### Serious Misconduct

Serious misconduct may warrant immediate action and can include:
- Harassment or discrimination
- Violence or threats
- Theft, fraud, or embezzlement
- Data breaches or intentional security violations
- Substance abuse at work

## Progressive Discipline Steps

Not all steps are required in every situation. Depending on the severity and frequency of the issue, Acme may start at any step.

1. **Informal Coaching**
2. **Verbal Warning**
3. **Written Warning**
4. **Final Written Warning or Performance Improvement Plan (PIP)**
5. **Termination of Employment**

### 1. Informal Coaching

Managers should first attempt to resolve minor issues through informal coaching:
- Describe the issue and its impact.
- Clarify expectations and provide examples.
- Agree on specific actions and timelines.

Managers are encouraged to keep brief notes on coaching discussions.

### 2. Verbal Warning

If issues persist, a verbal warning may be given:
- Manager meets with the employee and clearly states that this is a formal verbal warning.
- Discussion focuses on specific behaviors, expectations, and consequences of not improving.
- Manager documents the conversation in their own records and may note it in the HR system.

### 3. Written Warning

If behavior or performance does not improve, a written warning may be issued:
- HR should be consulted before issuing a written warning.
- The written warning includes:
  - Description of the issue
  - Previous attempts to address it
  - Expectations for improvement
  - Timeframe for improvement
  - Consequences of not improving
- The employee receives a copy and may add written comments.

### 4. Final Warning or Performance Improvement Plan (PIP)

For ongoing or more serious issues:

- A **Final Written Warning** may be issued when immediate and significant improvement is required.
- A **PIP** may be used when more structured support is appropriate.

PIPs typically include:
- Specific performance or behavior expectations
- Measurable goals and success criteria
- Support or resources to be provided
- Regular check-ins (weekly or more frequent)
- Clear timeline (often 30–90 days)

### 5. Termination

If there is no sufficient improvement or if the misconduct is severe, employment may be terminated.

HR and Legal must be consulted before termination decisions are made.

## Investigation Process

When serious allegations are made (e.g., harassment, fraud, policy violations), Acme may conduct an investigation.

### Steps in an Investigation

1. **Intake**: HR receives a report via manager, HR, or Ethics Hotline.
2. **Planning**: HR defines scope, evidence needed, and interview list.
3. **Interviews**: HR (and sometimes Legal) interview involved parties and witnesses.
4. **Evidence Review**: HR reviews documents, emails, system logs, etc., as appropriate.
5. **Findings**: HR evaluates evidence and determines whether allegations are substantiated.
6. **Action**: HR and management decide on appropriate next steps.

### Confidentiality

- Information is shared only with those who need to know.
- Participants are expected to keep details confidential.
- Retaliation against participants is prohibited.

## Employee Rights and Responsibilities

### Employees Have the Right To

- Be informed of concerns about their performance or conduct.
- Share their perspective and provide additional context or information.
- Ask questions about expectations and next steps.
- Report concerns about fairness, bias, or retaliation to HR.

### Employees Are Responsible For

- Meeting performance and conduct expectations.
- Cooperating with investigations.
- Following company policies and procedures.

## Attendance and Punctuality

### Expectations

- Employees are expected to arrive on time and be ready to work at the start of their scheduled shift.
- Planned absences should be requested in advance through the HR or timekeeping system.

### Unplanned Absences

- Notify your manager as soon as possible when sick or unable to work.
- Follow local team procedures (call, text, or Slack plus formal request if required).

### Excessive Absenteeism or Tardiness

Patterns of absences or lateness may lead to disciplinary action. HR will consider:
- Frequency and patterns (e.g., Mondays/Fridays)
- Impact on team and business
- Any underlying medical or personal issues

Employees are encouraged to discuss challenges early so HR and managers can explore support options.

## Documentation

Managers should document:
- Dates and summaries of coaching and warning discussions
- Copies of written warnings and PIPs
- Employee responses or comments

Documentation should be factual, objective, and free of personal bias.

## Appeals and Concerns

Employees who believe disciplinary action was unfair should:
1. Discuss the concern with their manager.
2. If unresolved, raise the issue with their HR Business Partner.
3. In certain cases, request a review by another manager or HR leader.

HR will review the situation and may uphold, modify, or reverse decisions.

## Retaliation Prohibited

Acme prohibits retaliation against employees who:
- Report concerns or misconduct in good faith
- Participate in investigations

Retaliation itself may be considered serious misconduct.

## Questions

For questions about this policy or a specific situation:
- Contact your manager or HR Business Partner.
- Review the full Employee Handbook on the HR Portal.
- Use the Ethics Hotline if you are uncomfortable raising concerns directly.
