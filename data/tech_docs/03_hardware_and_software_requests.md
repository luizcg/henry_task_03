## Requesting New Hardware

### For New Hires

New hire hardware is requested as part of the onboarding process:

1. Hiring manager completes the New Hire Request form.
2. HR and IT receive notification.
3. IT prepares and ships hardware before the start date.

No separate ticket is required unless there are special needs.

### For Existing Employees

If you need new or replacement hardware:

1. Go to **it.acme-corp.com**.
2. Click **"Request Hardware"**.
3. Select the type of request:
   - New laptop
   - Replacement due to damage or performance issues
   - Additional monitor or accessories
4. Provide justification and any relevant details.
5. Your manager will receive an approval request.

IT will review and fulfill approved requests based on stock availability and hardware standards.

### Replacement Cycles

Typical refresh cycles:

- Laptops: every 3–4 years, depending on condition
- Monitors: every 5 years, unless failure occurs
- Peripherals: as needed when broken or obsolete

If your device is older than the standard cycle and experiencing performance issues, mention this in your request.

## Damaged or Lost Equipment

### Damaged Equipment

If your device is damaged (e.g., dropped, liquid spill):

1. Immediately power off the device if safe to do so.
2. Do not attempt repairs yourself.
3. Submit a ticket via **it.acme-corp.com** with photos if possible.

IT will assess whether repair or replacement is needed. Some accidental damage may require a cost-sharing arrangement, depending on circumstances and frequency.

### Lost or Stolen Equipment

If your device is lost or stolen:

1. Notify **Security (security@acme-corp.com)** and **IT Help Desk** immediately.
2. Provide details: last known location, time, circumstances.
3. File a police report if required (especially for theft).

IT will:

- Remotely lock or wipe the device when possible.
- Block device access to corporate resources.
- Coordinate replacement hardware.

## Standard Software

### Pre-Installed Software

Company-managed laptops come with standard software, including:

- Operating system (macOS or Windows)
- Office suite (Microsoft 365)
- Slack
- Web browsers (Chrome, Edge, Safari where applicable)
- VPN client
- Endpoint protection and security tools
- Company portal apps (Self Service / Company Portal)

### Department-Specific Tools

- **Marketing**: Design and analytics tools

## Requesting Software or Application Access

### Standard Software Catalog

Most software is available through self-service catalogs:

- **Windows**: Company Portal app
- **macOS**: Self Service app

Steps:

1. Open the catalog app on your laptop.
2. Browse or search for the application.
3. Click **Install**.

If the software is in the catalog, no IT ticket is required.

### Software Not in the Catalog

If the software you need is not listed:

1. Submit a request at **it.acme-corp.com** with subject "New Software Request".
2. Include:
   - Application name and vendor
   - Business justification (what you need it for)
   - Number of users and expected duration
   - Any known licensing or cost information
3. Your manager and, if needed, the Procurement or Security team will review the request.

Software will be evaluated for:
- Security and compliance risks
- Overlap with existing tools
- Cost and budget impact

### SaaS and Web Applications

Access to SaaS tools is typically provisioned via SSO (Single Sign-On).

To request access:

1. Identify the app in the **App Access Portal** (apps.acme-corp.com).
2. Click **Request Access**.
3. Your manager will receive an approval notification.
4. Upon approval, access is usually granted automatically.

## Admin and Elevated Access

### Local Admin Rights

Local admin rights are restricted to limit security risks.

Employees may request temporary admin rights to:
- Install specialized tools
- Perform development or testing tasks

Requests must include:
- Specific reason
- Duration needed
- Confirmation from manager

IT may:
- Grant just-in-time admin access
- Offer alternative solutions (e.g., IT-installed software)

### Server and Production Access

Access to servers, databases, and production environments is tightly controlled.

To request access:
- Follow the procedures in the **Production Access Policy** (see Security docs).
- Obtain approvals from your manager, system owner, and Security.

## License Management

### License Types

Common license models:
- Named user licenses
- Concurrent/shared licenses
- Usage-based or consumption licenses

IT and Procurement track license usage to minimize waste and ensure compliance.

### Reclaiming Licenses

Licenses may be removed when:
- An employee has not used the tool for 60–90 days.
- The employee changes roles and no longer needs the tool.
- The license is needed for another user.

Employees will be notified when licenses are reclaimed. Access can be re-requested if needed.
