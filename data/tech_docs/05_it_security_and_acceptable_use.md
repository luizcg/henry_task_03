# IT Security and Acceptable Use Policy - Acme Corporation

## Purpose

This policy defines how employees must use Acme’s information systems, networks, and data to protect the company, our customers, and ourselves from security threats.

## Scope

Applies to all employees, contractors, and temporary workers who use:
- Company laptops, desktops, and mobile devices
- Corporate networks and VPN
- SaaS applications used for Acme business
- Customer and company data in any form

## Key Principles

- Protect customer and company data at all times.
- Use company systems for legitimate business purposes.
- Follow security guidelines and report incidents quickly.

## Device Security

### Company Devices

Employees must:
- Use only company-managed devices for accessing sensitive systems.
- Keep operating systems and security software up to date.
- Lock screens when away from their desk.
- Avoid jailbreaking/rooting devices used for work.

Lost or stolen devices must be reported to IT and Security immediately.

### Personal Devices (BYOD)

Personal devices may only be used for limited tasks (e.g., email, calendar) and must:
- Be protected with a strong PIN or password.
- Have device encryption enabled where supported.
- Allow remote wipe if connected to corporate email.

Engineering and production systems must **not** be accessed from personal devices.

## Account Security

See also: **Account and Password Management Guide**.

Employees must:
- Use unique, strong passwords for Acme accounts.
- Enable and regularly use MFA.
- Never share passwords with anyone.

Password managers approved by Security are recommended for storing work-related credentials.

## Data Handling

### Data Classification

Acme classifies data into:
- **Public** – Safe to share externally (e.g., marketing materials).
- **Internal** – For employees only, not public.
- **Confidential** – Sensitive business data, customer data, financials.
- **Restricted** – Highly sensitive data with strict access controls.

Employees must handle data according to its classification.

### Storage and Sharing

- Store company data only in approved locations (OneDrive, SharePoint, internal systems).
- Do not use personal cloud storage (e.g., personal Google Drive, Dropbox) for company data.
- Share documents with the minimum necessary audience.
- Avoid sending confidential data via unencrypted email when possible.

### Data Transfer

- Use secure transfer methods (SFTP, HTTPS, VPN) for sensitive data.
- Do not transfer customer data to personal devices or email accounts.

## Acceptable Use of Technology

### Permitted Use

Company systems are provided primarily for business use. Limited personal use is allowed if it:
- Does not interfere with work duties.
- Does not violate any law or company policy.

- Access or distribute illegal or offensive content.
- Harass or discriminate against others.

- Circumvent security controls or monitoring.

## Software and Tools

- Install only approved software from the Company Portal or Self Service.
- Do not download random executables from the internet.
- Do not disable antivirus, firewalls, or endpoint protection.

Requests for new tools must follow the **Hardware and Software Requests** process.

## Phishing and Social Engineering
