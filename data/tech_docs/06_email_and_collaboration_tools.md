# Email and Collaboration Tools Guide

## Overview

Acme Corporation provides enterprise-grade email and collaboration tools to enable seamless communication and teamwork across the organization. This guide covers setup, best practices, and troubleshooting for our primary collaboration platforms.

## Corporate Email (Microsoft 365)

### Email Setup

All employees receive a corporate email address in the format `firstname.lastname@acmecorp.com`. Your email account is automatically provisioned during onboarding.

#### Desktop Setup
- **Outlook Desktop**: Pre-configured on company-issued laptops
- **Manual Setup**: Use `outlook.office365.com` as the server
- **Authentication**: Use your corporate credentials with MFA

#### Mobile Setup
1. Download Microsoft Outlook from your device's app store
2. Add your corporate email address
3. Complete MFA authentication
4. Email, calendar, and contacts will sync automatically

### Email Best Practices

- **Response Time**: Aim to respond to internal emails within 24 business hours
- **Subject Lines**: Use clear, descriptive subject lines
- **CC vs BCC**: Use CC for transparency, BCC for large distribution lists
- **Attachments**: Use OneDrive links for files over 10MB
- **Signatures**: Use the company-approved email signature template

### Email Storage Limits

| Account Type | Storage Limit |
|--------------|---------------|
| Standard Employee | 50 GB |
| Manager/Director | 100 GB |
| Executive | Unlimited |

When approaching your limit, archive older emails or delete unnecessary messages.

## Microsoft Teams

### Getting Started

Microsoft Teams is our primary platform for instant messaging, video calls, and team collaboration.

#### Channels and Teams
- **Department Teams**: Auto-joined based on your department
- **Project Teams**: Request access through your manager
- **Private Channels**: For sensitive discussions within a team

#### Status Settings
- **Available**: Ready for communication
- **Busy**: In meetings or focused work
- **Do Not Disturb**: Blocks all notifications
- **Away**: Automatically set after 5 minutes of inactivity

### Video Conferencing

#### Before Your Meeting
1. Test your camera and microphone in Settings > Devices
2. Check your background (blur or virtual backgrounds available)
3. Join 1-2 minutes early for important meetings

#### Meeting Best Practices
- Mute when not speaking
- Use the raise hand feature in large meetings
- Share screens through Teams, not external tools
- Record meetings only with participant consent

### Teams Phone System

Corporate phone extensions are integrated with Teams:
- Dial internal extensions directly from Teams
- Access voicemail through the Calls tab
- Set up call forwarding in Settings > Calls

## SharePoint and OneDrive

### OneDrive for Business

Personal cloud storage for work files:
- **Storage**: 1 TB per user
- **Sync**: Desktop sync client auto-installed
- **Sharing**: Right-click files to share with colleagues

#### File Versioning
OneDrive maintains 500 versions of each file. To restore:
1. Right-click the file
2. Select "Version history"
3. Choose the version to restore

### SharePoint Sites

Team and department sites for shared documents:
- **Document Libraries**: Shared file storage with metadata
- **Lists**: Structured data tracking (tasks, issues, inventory)
- **Pages**: Internal wikis and announcements

#### Permissions
- **Read**: View and download files
- **Edit**: Modify existing files
- **Full Control**: Manage permissions and settings

## Slack (Legacy)

Some teams still use Slack for specific projects. If you need Slack access:
1. Submit a request through the IT Service Portal
2. Specify the workspace and channels needed
3. Approval required from your manager

Note: Slack is being phased out. New projects should use Microsoft Teams.
