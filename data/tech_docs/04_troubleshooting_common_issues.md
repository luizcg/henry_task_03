This guide covers common IT issues employees encounter and the recommended first steps before contacting the IT Help Desk.

## Email Issues

### Cannot Send or Receive Email

1. Check internet connectivity by opening a web page.
2. Confirm you are signed in to Outlook with your Acme account.
3. If prompted, re-enter your password and complete MFA.
4. Check **Service Status** at status.office.com for known outages.
5. If the issue persists, restart Outlook or your computer.

### Mailbox Is Full

## VPN and Network Issues

### Cannot Connect to VPN

- Try a different network or restart your router.
- Verify that your password and MFA are working.

### Slow or Unstable Connection

- Close bandwidth-heavy apps (streaming, downloads).

- For critical work, use a wired connection when possible.

## Laptop Performance Issues

### Slow Performance

- Restart your laptop (many users skip this).
- Close unused apps and browser tabs.
- Check for available disk space (keep at least 15–20% free).

If performance issues persist, open a ticket with system details and recent changes (new apps installed, etc.).
