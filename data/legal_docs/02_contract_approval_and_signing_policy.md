# Contract Approval and Signing Policy - Acme Corporation Legal

## Purpose

This policy establishes how contracts with customers, vendors, and partners are reviewed, approved, and signed at Acme Corporation.

## Scope

Covers all written agreements that create obligations for Acme, including:

- Customer agreements (MSAs, order forms, SOWs)
- Vendor and supplier contracts
- Partner and reseller agreements
- Non-disclosure agreements (NDAs)
- Data processing agreements (DPAs)

## Key Principles

- No employee may bind Acme to a contract unless they have proper authority.
- Contracts must be reviewed by Legal and, where appropriate, by Security, Finance, and other stakeholders.
- Standard templates should be used whenever possible.

## Contract Lifecycle Overview

1. **Initiation** – Business owner identifies the need for a contract.
2. **Drafting** – Preferred use of Acme standard templates.
3. **Review** – Legal and other stakeholders review terms.
4. **Approval** – Internal approvals captured per authority matrix.
5. **Signature** – Contract executed via approved e-signature platform.
6. **Storage** – Final contract stored in the Contract Repository.

## Using Standard Templates

Acme provides approved templates for:

- Mutual and one-way NDAs
- Master Service Agreements (MSAs)
- Order Forms and Statements of Work
- Data Processing Agreements

Employees should start with these templates and request deviations only when necessary.

## Legal Review Requirements

### Mandatory Legal Review

Legal must review contracts when:

- Non-standard terms are requested.
- Liability, indemnity, or IP terms are modified.
- Contract value or risk exceeds established thresholds.
- The counterparty provides their own paper (their template).

### Information to Provide to Legal

- Business context and objectives
- Pricing and commercial terms
- Any deadlines or launch dates
- Known redlines or issues from the counterparty

## Approval and Signature Authority

### Delegation of Authority

Acme maintains a **Delegation of Authority (DOA)** matrix specifying who can approve:

- Financial commitments at various thresholds
- Multi-year contracts
- Exceptions to standard terms (e.g., unlimited liability)

Employees must consult the DOA matrix and obtain required approvals before signature.

### Who Can Sign Contracts

Only designated officers or authorized signatories may sign contracts on behalf of Acme. Examples include:

- CEO
- CFO
- CRO / VP of Sales (customer agreements within thresholds)
- General Counsel or authorized Legal representatives

Employees **must not** sign contracts in their own name or on behalf of "Acme" without explicit authority.

## E-Signature Platform

All contracts should be executed through the approved e-signature platform (e.g., DocuSign):

- Ensures proper identity verification and audit trail.
- Automatically stores fully executed copies.

Uploading scanned, manually signed documents is discouraged except when counterparties cannot use e-signature.

## Redlines and Negotiations

### Handling Redlines

- Business owners should not accept legal terms without review.
- Legal should manage or oversee material legal redlines.
- Track all changes using version control and comments.

### Negotiation Guidelines

- Protect Acme against unlimited liability.
- Avoid broad indemnities that are not reciprocal.
- Retain ownership of core intellectual property.
- Ensure data protection obligations are appropriate and realistic.

## Contract Storage and Recordkeeping

Fully executed contracts must be stored in the central **Contract Repository**:

- Indexed by customer/vendor name, effective date, and type.
- Accessible to authorized teams (Legal, Sales Ops, Procurement, Finance).

Storing the only copy of a contract in personal email or local folders is prohibited.

## Renewals and Terminations

- Business owners should monitor renewal dates and notice periods.
- Automatic renewals should be reviewed periodically for ongoing business need.
- Termination rights and obligations (e.g., data return, wind-down) must be followed.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I sign a small NDA without Legal?**
A: Use the standard NDA template and follow the signing process. If the other party insists on their NDA, send it to Legal.

**Q: The customer says their terms are "non-negotiable". What should I do?**
A: Forward the contract and context to Legal. Only Legal and authorized leaders can agree to accept non-standard risk.

**Q: Where can I find the latest templates and DOA matrix?**
A: On the Legal page of the internal Wiki or by emailing **legal@acme-corp.com**.
