# Marketing and External Communications Review Policy

This policy describes when and how marketing materials and external communications must be reviewed by the Legal team at Acme Corporation.

## 1. Scope

This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and agencies who create or distribute content on behalf of Acme, including:

- Website content and landing pages.
- Press releases and media statements.
- Case studies, whitepapers, and ebooks.
- Sales collateral and pitch decks.
- Social media posts on corporate channels.
- Advertising campaigns (digital, print, out-of-home).

## 2. Objectives

The goals of the review process are to:

- Ensure compliance with advertising and consumer protection laws.
- Prevent misleading or deceptive statements.
- Protect confidential information and trade secrets.
- Respect intellectual property rights (our own and others').
- Maintain consistent, accurate messaging about Acme's products and services.

## 3. When Legal Review Is Required

Legal review is required when content:

- Makes **comparative claims** about competitors ("faster than", "cheaper than").
- Includes **customer logos, names, or testimonials**.
- References **regulated industries or sensitive use cases** (e.g., healthcare, finance).
- Contains **guarantees or warranties**.
- Uses **third-party content** (e.g., images, music, code snippets) not clearly licensed.

Routine, low-risk content updates (e.g., minor copy edits) may not require full review but should still follow brand and style guidelines.

## 4. Submission Process

1. Prepare a draft of the material and identify:
   - Target audience.
   - Distribution channels.
   - Timelines for launch.
2. Submit the draft to the Marketing and Legal review queue using the designated system.
3. Include references or source data for any claims (e.g., benchmarks, customer quotes).
4. Allow sufficient lead time (e.g., **5–7 business days**) for review.

## 5. Review Outcomes

Legal may:

- Approve the content as-is.
- Request clarifications or edits.
- Require removal or rephrasing of certain statements.
- Request additional substantiation for claims.

Final approval should be documented in the review system or via email.

## 6. Use of Customer Names and Logos

Before using customer names, quotes, or logos:

- Confirm that the customer has signed a **marketing consent** or case study agreement.
- Ensure that usage complies with any restrictions (e.g., no press releases without pre-approval).

Unauthorized use of customer branding can violate contracts and damage relationships.

## 7. Third-Party Content and Licensing

Any third-party content used in marketing must be properly licensed. This includes:

- Stock photos and icons.
- Music and video clips.
- Code snippets or frameworks (when publicly referenced).

Team members must:

- Use approved asset libraries where possible.
- Retain proof of license or permission.

## 8. Social Media Guidelines

For corporate social media accounts:

- Do not disclose non-public financial or product information.
- Avoid commenting on legal disputes, regulatory matters, or rumors.
- Refer media inquiries to the Communications team.

Employees using personal accounts must not represent themselves as speaking on behalf of Acme unless authorized.

## 9. Record Keeping

Marketing and Legal should retain records of:

- Approved materials.
- Key campaigns and their review history.
- Customer consents and usage rights.

This supports compliance, audit readiness, and consistent messaging over time.

## 10. Questions

Questions about this policy or specific campaigns should be directed to:

- The Marketing Operations team.
- The Legal team via the internal ticketing system.

Following this policy helps ensure that Acme's external communications are accurate, compliant, and aligned with our brand.
