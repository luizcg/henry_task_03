# Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Policy

This policy outlines Acme Corporation's commitment to conducting business ethically and in compliance with anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws.

## 1. Policy Statement

Acme has **zero tolerance** for bribery and corruption. Employees and representatives must never:

- Offer, give, request, or accept bribes.
- Facilitate improper payments to government officials or private individuals.
- Use third parties to do indirectly what we cannot do directly.

## 2. Who Is Covered

This policy applies to:

- All employees and officers.
- Contractors and temporary workers.
- Agents, consultants, and intermediaries acting on Acme's behalf.

## 3. What Is a Bribe?

A **bribe** is anything of value offered or received with the intent to improperly influence a decision or gain an unfair advantage. It can include:

- Cash or cash equivalents.
- Gifts, hospitality, or travel.
- Donations or sponsorships.
- Job offers or internships.

## 4. Interactions with Government Officials

Special care is required when dealing with government officials, which may include:

- Employees of government agencies.
- Officials of state-owned enterprises.
- Political candidates or party representatives.

Employees must not:

- Provide gifts or hospitality to government officials without prior Legal approval.
- Offer "facilitation payments" (small unofficial payments to speed up routine actions).

## 5. Gifts and Hospitality

Reasonable, infrequent gifts and hospitality may be allowed if they are:

- Modest in value.
- Appropriate to the occasion.
- Not intended to influence a specific decision.

High-value or frequent gifts, lavish entertainment, or anything that could appear improper is prohibited.

## 6. Third Parties and Due Diligence

Acme may be liable for the actions of third parties acting on its behalf. Therefore:

- Appropriate due diligence must be performed on agents, distributors, and consultants.
- Contracts should include anti-bribery and compliance clauses.
- Red flags (e.g., requests for cash payments, unusually high commissions) must be escalated.

## 7. Books and Records

All transactions must be accurately recorded in Acme's books and records. Employees must not:

- Create false or misleading entries.
- Use off-the-books accounts or slush funds.

## 8. Training and Awareness

Employees in high-risk roles (e.g., sales, procurement, government-facing teams) may be required to complete periodic anti-bribery training.

## 9. Reporting Concerns

Suspected violations should be reported through:

- The ethics hotline.
- The Compliance or Legal teams.
- A manager or HR representative.

Reports can often be made anonymously where permitted by law. Retaliation against good-faith reporters is strictly prohibited.

## 10. Consequences of Violations

Violations of this policy can result in:

- Disciplinary action, up to and including termination.
- Civil and criminal penalties for individuals and the company.

Employees are expected to seek guidance from Legal or Compliance when unsure whether a planned action may violate this policy.
