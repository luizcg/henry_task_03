# Export Controls and Sanctions Compliance Guide

This guide summarizes Acme Corporation's obligations under export control and economic sanctions laws.

## 1. Overview

Export controls and sanctions regulate:

- Which products, software, and technologies can be exported.
- To which countries, entities, or individuals exports are allowed.
- For what end uses and end users.

Non-compliance can lead to severe penalties, including fines, loss of export privileges, and criminal liability.

## 2. Key Concepts

- **Export**: Any transfer of technology, software, or services to a foreign country or foreign person, including via email or remote access.
- **Sanctions**: Government-imposed restrictions on dealing with certain countries, entities, or individuals.
- **Denied or Restricted Parties**: Individuals or organizations listed by governments as prohibited counterparties.

## 3. Restricted Countries and Parties

Acme must comply with sanctions imposed by the jurisdictions in which it operates. This may include:

- Comprehensive sanctions on certain countries.
- Targeted sanctions on specific individuals or entities.

Employees must not:

- Conduct business with customers or partners on restricted party lists.
- Bypass sanctions through intermediaries or shell companies.

## 4. Screening and Due Diligence

Before engaging with new customers or partners:

- Perform restricted party screening using approved tools.
- Review red flags such as unusual payment structures or routing.

Sales, Legal, and Compliance work together to assess higher-risk situations.

## 5. Technology and Data Transfers

Export controls may apply to:

- Software downloads from Acme's platforms.
- Remote access to systems from abroad.
- Sharing technical information with foreign nationals.

Certain technologies may require export licenses. Engineering and Product teams should consult Legal when:

- Designing features that could have dual-use (civilian and military) applications.
- Serving customers in higher-risk jurisdictions.

## 6. Travel with Company Devices

When traveling internationally with laptops or mobile devices:

- Use only company-approved devices and configurations.
- Do not carry restricted or sensitive data to high-risk destinations without approval.

In some cases, "clean" devices may be required for travel to certain countries.

## 7. Red Flags

Examples of potential red flags:

- Requests to ship products to a freight forwarder without clear end customer details.
- Unusual urgency for transactions with high-risk jurisdictions.
- Customers reluctant to provide information about end use or end users.

Red flags should be escalated to Legal or Compliance before proceeding.

## 8. Training and Responsibilities

- Employees in export-sensitive roles (e.g., sales, logistics, product) may receive specific training.
- All employees are expected to be aware of basic restrictions and ask for help when uncertain.

## 9. Reporting and Escalation

Suspected violations or concerns should be reported to:

- The Legal or Compliance team.
- The ethics hotline.

Acme will investigate and, where appropriate, self-report to authorities.

## 10. Getting Help

Questions about export controls or sanctions compliance should be directed to the Legal or Compliance teams. They can provide guidance on:

- Screening customers and partners.
- Licensing requirements.
- Product and feature design considerations.
