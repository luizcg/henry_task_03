# Privacy and Data Protection Policy - Acme Corporation Legal

## Purpose

This policy describes how Acme Corporation handles personal data belonging to customers, employees, and other individuals. It is designed to comply with applicable privacy laws (such as GDPR, CCPA, and similar regulations) and to protect the trust placed in us.

## Scope

This policy applies to:

- All Acme employees, contractors, and temporary workers
- All systems and processes that collect, store, or process personal data
- Personal data of customers, prospects, employees, candidates, and vendors

## Definitions

- **Personal Data**: Any information that identifies or can reasonably be linked to an individual (e.g., name, email, IP address, ID numbers).
- **Sensitive Personal Data**: Data such as health information, financial account numbers, government IDs, precise location, and similar.
- **Processing**: Any operation performed on personal data (collection, storage, use, sharing, deletion, etc.).
- **Data Subject**: An individual whose personal data is processed.

## Data Collection Principles

We follow these core principles:

1. **Lawfulness, Fairness, and Transparency** – We process personal data only when we have a lawful basis and communicate clearly how it is used.
2. **Purpose Limitation** – We collect data for specific, explicit, and legitimate purposes.
3. **Data Minimization** – We collect only the data necessary for the stated purposes.
4. **Accuracy** – We take reasonable steps to keep data accurate and up to date.
5. **Storage Limitation** – We do not keep personal data longer than necessary.
6. **Integrity and Confidentiality** – We protect data with appropriate security measures.

## Legal Bases for Processing

Depending on the context, Acme may rely on:

- **Contract**: Processing necessary to perform a contract or provide a service.
- **Consent**: Explicit permission given by the data subject.
- **Legitimate Interests**: Our business interests, balanced against the individual’s rights.
- **Legal Obligation**: Processing required to comply with laws or regulations.

Product and engineering teams must consult Legal when designing features that process personal data.

## Data Subject Rights

Where applicable law provides, data subjects may have the following rights:

- **Access** – Request a copy of their personal data.
- **Rectification** – Request corrections of inaccurate data.
- **Erasure** – Request deletion of certain personal data ("right to be forgotten").
- **Restriction** – Request limits on how data is processed.
- **Portability** – Receive data in a structured, commonly used format.
- **Objection** – Object to certain types of processing.

Requests should be submitted to **privacy@acme-corp.com**. Employees receiving such requests must forward them to Legal within **2 business days**.

## Data Retention

Acme maintains a **Data Retention Schedule** specifying how long different types of data are kept. In general:

- Customer account data: retained while the account is active and for a defined period afterward (e.g., 3–7 years) for legal and audit purposes.
- Marketing data: retained until consent is withdrawn or after a defined period of inactivity.
- HR and employee data: retained according to employment and labor law requirements.

Once retention periods expire, data must be securely deleted or anonymized.

## International Data Transfers

When personal data is transferred across borders:

- We use approved mechanisms (e.g., Standard Contractual Clauses, adequacy decisions).
- We assess legal and security risks in destination countries.
- Additional safeguards may be implemented where required.

Any cross-border transfer solution must be reviewed by Legal and Security.

## Data Breach Response

A **data breach** is a security incident that leads to accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to personal data.

### If You Suspect a Breach

1. Immediately notify **security@acme-corp.com** and **legal@acme-corp.com**.
2. Do not delete or alter logs or evidence.
3. Do not communicate externally about the incident unless authorized.

### Legal and Regulatory Notifications

Legal will determine:

- Whether the incident meets the threshold for notification under applicable laws.
- Which authorities and data subjects must be notified.
- The content and timing of such notifications.

## Privacy by Design and Default

Teams must incorporate privacy considerations from the start:

- Use data minimization and pseudonymization where possible.
- Limit access to personal data based on role.
- Conduct **Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs)** for high-risk processing.

Legal and Security can assist with DPIAs and design reviews.

## Vendor and Subprocessor Management

When working with third parties that process personal data on our behalf:

- A **Data Processing Agreement (DPA)** must be in place.
- Vendors must meet our security and privacy standards.
- Data flows must be documented and reviewed.

The Vendor Management and Legal teams coordinate vendor due diligence.

## Employee Responsibilities

All employees must:

- Handle personal data only for legitimate business purposes.
- Access only the data necessary for their role.
- Follow security policies and report incidents promptly.
- Complete required privacy and security training.

Violations of this policy may result in disciplinary action.
