# Third-Party Risk Management Policy

This policy describes how Acme Corporation assesses and manages risks associated with third-party vendors, partners, and service providers.

## 1. Purpose

Third parties can introduce risks related to:

## 2. Scope

The policy applies to:

- Vendors and suppliers.
- Resellers and distribution partners.
- Outsourced service providers (e.g., payroll, IT hosting).

## 3. Risk Assessment

Before onboarding a new third party, Acme assesses risk based on:

- Data access: Will the third party process personal or confidential data?
- Criticality: How important is the service to Acme's operations?
- Regulatory environment: Are there specific laws or regulations involved (e.g., healthcare, finance)?

Higher-risk third parties undergo more detailed due diligence.

## 6. Ongoing Monitoring

Third-party risk does not end at onboarding. Ongoing monitoring may involve:

- Periodic reassessments.
- Review of updated certifications.
- Performance and incident reviews.

## 7. Roles and Responsibilities

- **Business Owners**: Initiate engagements and manage day-to-day relationships.
- **Security and Privacy Teams**: Assess technical and privacy risks.
- **Legal**: Review and negotiate contractual protections.
- **Procurement**: Coordinate the overall process.

## 8. Incident Management

If a third party experiences a security or compliance incident affecting Acme:

- Acme will coordinate investigation, remediation, and any required notifications.

## 9. Termination

Acme may terminate relationships with third parties who:

- Fail to meet contractual obligations.
- Present unacceptable levels of risk.
