## Commitment to Ethics

Acme is committed to:

- Complying with applicable laws and regulations.
- Maintaining high ethical standards.
- Providing a safe environment for employees to speak up without fear of retaliation.

## What to Report

Employees should report concerns such as:

- Fraud, theft, or embezzlement.
- Bribery or corruption.
- Harassment or discrimination.
- Safety violations.
- Data privacy or security breaches.
- Conflicts of interest.
- Violations of company policies or the Code of Conduct.

If in doubt, it is better to report and let the company assess the issue.

## How to Report

You can report concerns through several channels:

1. **Your Manager** – Often the first point of contact.
2. **Human Resources** – For workplace behavior and people-related issues.
3. **Legal or Compliance** – For legal, regulatory, or policy concerns.
4. **Ethics Hotline** – For anonymous or confidential reporting.

### Ethics Hotline

- Available 24/7.
- Operated by an independent third party.
- Accessible by phone and web.
- Allows anonymous reporting where permitted by law.

Contact details for the Ethics Hotline are published in the Code of Conduct and on the intranet.

## Non-Retaliation

Acme prohibits retaliation against anyone who, in good faith:

- Reports a concern or suspected violation.
- Participates in an investigation.

Retaliation may include demotion, termination, harassment, or other adverse actions. Allegations of retaliation will be investigated separately and may lead to discipline.

## Investigation Process

When a report is received:

1. **Intake and Triage** – Compliance or HR logs the report and determines initial risk and urgency.
2. **Assignment** – The matter is assigned to appropriate investigators (HR, Legal, Security, or a combination).
3. **Investigation** – Interviews, document review, and evidence gathering.
4. **Findings and Actions** – Determination of whether policies were violated and what remedial actions are required.
5. **Closure** – Conclusions are documented; reporter is informed if appropriate.

Confidentiality is maintained to the extent possible while allowing a thorough investigation.

## Records and Documentation

- Reports and investigation records are stored securely.
- Access is limited to those with a legitimate need to know.
- Retention periods follow the company’s records retention schedule.

## Employee Responsibilities

Employees are expected to:

- Raise concerns promptly when they become aware of potential issues.
- Provide truthful and complete information.
- Cooperate with investigations.

Knowingly making false accusations or providing misleading information may itself be a policy violation.
