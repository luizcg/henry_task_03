# Records Retention and Legal Holds Policy - Acme Corporation Legal

## Purpose

This policy defines how long Acme retains different types of records and what to do when a legal hold is issued.

## Records Retention

Acme maintains records to:

- Comply with legal, tax, and regulatory requirements.
- Support business operations.
- Preserve evidence in case of disputes or investigations.

A detailed **Records Retention Schedule** defines retention periods by record type (e.g., contracts, financial records, HR files, system logs).

### General Guidelines

- Do not keep records longer than necessary, unless required by law or legal hold.
- Do not delete or destroy records outside of approved processes.
- When in doubt, consult Legal or your Records Management contact.

## Legal Holds

### What Is a Legal Hold?

A legal hold is a directive from Legal to preserve certain information because it may be relevant to:

- A pending or reasonably anticipated lawsuit.
- A government investigation.
- An internal investigation.

### Receiving a Legal Hold Notice

If you receive a legal hold notice:

- Read the instructions carefully.
- Acknowledge receipt, if requested.
- Follow all directions regarding what data to preserve.

The notice will typically describe:

- The general subject matter (without revealing privileged details).
- Types of information to preserve (emails, documents, chat messages, logs).
- Systems or locations where relevant data may reside.

### Your Obligations Under a Legal Hold

You must:

- Suspend routine deletion of relevant records.
- Preserve relevant documents, emails, and files in their original form.
- Not alter, delete, or conceal relevant information.
- Inform Legal if you change roles or leave the company.

Failure to comply with a legal hold can create serious legal risk for Acme and may result in discipline.

## Lifting a Legal Hold

When a legal hold is no longer needed, Legal will issue a **lift notice**:

- Routine deletion and retention schedules may resume.
- Do not assume a legal hold is over until you receive written confirmation.
