# Cost Center and Budget Ownership Guide

This guide explains how cost centers, budgets, and financial ownership work at Acme Corporation. It is intended for managers, budget owners, and anyone submitting expenses or purchase requests.

## 1. What Is a Cost Center?

A **cost center** is a financial segment used to track expenses for a specific team, function, or initiative. Each cost center has:

- A unique identifier (e.g., `1001-ENG-PLATFORM`).
- A named owner (usually a manager or director).
- An annual budget, divided into categories (e.g., travel, software, contractors).

Cost centers allow Acme to:

- Understand where money is being spent.
- Hold leaders accountable for staying within budget.
- Support financial planning and forecasting.

## 2. Roles and Responsibilities

### 2.1 Cost Center Owners

Cost center owners are responsible for:

- Reviewing and approving expenses charged to their cost centers.
- Monitoring budget-to-actuals on a monthly basis.
- Forecasting future spend and identifying risks.
- Ensuring expenses align with company policies.

### 2.2 Approvers and Delegates

In some cases, approvers may delegate approval authority to team leads or project managers. Delegates must:

- Understand the relevant budget constraints.
- Follow the same approval guidelines as the primary owner.
- Escalate large or unusual expenses to the owner.

### 2.3 Employees

Employees submitting expenses have responsibilities as well:

- Selecting the correct cost center for their department or project.
- Providing accurate descriptions and justifications.
- Ensuring that the expense has been verbally or formally approved when required.

## 3. Budget Categories

Each cost center budget is typically broken into categories, such as:

- **Travel and Entertainment (T&E)**: Airfare, hotels, meals, local transport.
- **Software and Subscriptions**: SaaS tools, licenses, support contracts.
- **Contractors and Services**: Temporary workers, consultants, agencies.
- **Training and Development**: Courses, conferences, certifications.
- **Equipment and Supplies**: Laptops, monitors, peripherals, office supplies.

Spending should be coded to the most appropriate category. Misclassification can distort reporting and complicate financial analysis.

## 4. Coding Expenses to Cost Centers

When submitting an expense report or purchase request, employees must:

1. Select the correct **cost center**.
2. Choose the appropriate **expense category**.
3. Provide a **clear business justification**.

### 4.1 Choosing the Right Cost Center

Use the following guidelines:

- **Departmental expenses**: Charge to your home department's cost center.
- **Project-specific expenses**: Charge to the project or initiative cost center, if one exists.
- **Cross-functional initiatives**: Costs may be split across multiple cost centers based on usage.

If you are unsure, ask your manager or the Finance team before submitting.

### 4.2 Splitting Costs

Some expenses should be split between cost centers, for example:

- A software license used by two departments.
- A joint offsite event hosted by multiple teams.

Splits should be:

- **Simple** (e.g., 50/50 or based on headcount).
- **Documented** in the justification notes.

## 5. Budget Monitoring and Reporting

### 5.1 Monthly Budget Reviews

Finance provides monthly budget-to-actual reports to cost center owners. These reports show:

- Budget vs. actual spend by category.
- Year-to-date spend and remaining budget.
- Significant variances and trends.

Owners are expected to:

- Review reports promptly.
- Investigate large variances.
- Take corrective action if overspend is likely.

### 5.2 Forecasting

In addition to actuals, owners should maintain a **forecast** of expected spend for the rest of the year, including:

- Planned hires and associated payroll costs.
- Upcoming vendor renewals.
- Major travel or events.

Finance may request updated forecasts quarterly or more frequently during periods of rapid change.

## 6. Approval Thresholds

Different levels of management may have different approval limits.

Example structure (actual values may vary by region):

- Manager: Up to $5,000 per transaction.
- Director: Up to $25,000 per transaction.
- VP: Up to $100,000 per transaction.
- CFO/CEO: Above $100,000.

Employees should ensure that the **designated approver** signs off on transactions that exceed their own authority.

## 7. Common Scenarios

### 7.1 New Software Subscription

1. Employee identifies a new SaaS tool.
2. Confirms with IT and Security that the tool meets technical and security requirements.
3. Confirms with the budget owner that budget is available.
4. Submits a purchase request coded to the appropriate cost center and category.
5. Receives approval before vendor onboarding begins.

### 7.2 Team Offsite Event

1. Manager estimates total cost (venue, travel, meals).
2. Confirms with Finance whether the cost should be split across multiple cost centers.
3. Obtains approval from the relevant budget owners.
4. Submits expenses with clear coding and justification.

### 7.3 Shared Contractor

A contractor works 60% for Engineering and 40% for Marketing.

- The vendor invoice is split 60/40 between the two cost centers.
- The split is documented in the purchase order and invoice notes.

## 8. Policy Compliance and Audits

Finance periodically reviews cost center activity to ensure:

- Compliance with approval limits.
- Proper coding of expenses.
- Absence of personal or inappropriate expenses.

Owners may be asked to provide additional context or documentation for specific transactions. Non-compliance may lead to corrective action or revised approval workflows.

## 9. Getting Help

If you have questions about cost centers or budgets:

- Contact your manager or budget owner for local guidance.
- Reach out to the Finance Business Partner for your organization.
- Submit questions via the internal Finance helpdesk.

Clear cost center ownership and accurate coding help Acme make better decisions, plan effectively, and ensure fairness across teams.
