# Travel and Corporate Card Guide - Acme Corporation Finance

## Overview

This guide complements the HR Travel and Expense Policy by focusing on financial aspects of business travel and corporate card usage.

## Corporate Card Eligibility

Corporate cards are issued to employees who:

- Travel regularly for business (typically 3+ trips per year), or
- Incur frequent reimbursable expenses as part of their role.

Eligibility is determined by the employee's manager and Finance.

## Corporate Card Application Process

1. Manager submits a **Corporate Card Request** to Finance.
2. Employee completes an online application form with the card provider.
3. Upon approval, the card is mailed to the employee's office or home address.
4. Employee activates the card and agrees to the **Cardholder Agreement**.

## Cardholder Responsibilities

Cardholders must:

- Use the card **only for business expenses**.
- Retain receipts for all transactions.
- Reconcile and code transactions in the Expense System.
- Report lost or stolen cards immediately.

Personal use of the corporate card is prohibited.

## Travel Advances

In general, Acme prefers the use of corporate cards or reimbursement rather than cash advances. However, travel advances may be issued when:

- Traveling to locations where cards are not widely accepted.
- Significant upfront cash payments are required.

Travel advances require:

- Approval from the employee's manager.
- Coordination with Finance, typically at least 2 weeks before travel.

Unused advance funds must be repaid within 10 business days of trip completion.

## Travel Booking and Payment

- Airfare, hotels, and rental cars should be booked through the **Travel Portal**.
- Whenever possible, expenses are charged to the corporate card.
- Some arrangements (e.g., centrally billed accounts) may be handled directly by Acme.

## Reconciling Corporate Card Transactions

1. Log into **expenses.acme-corp.com**.
2. Your corporate card transactions will appear automatically.
3. For each transaction:
   - Assign the correct **category** and **cost center/project**.
   - Add a clear **description** and **business purpose**.
   - Attach the **itemized receipt**.

Reconciliation should be completed **within 10 days** of the statement date.

## Delinquent Accounts

While corporate cards are typically paid directly by Acme, cardholder inaction (e.g., failing to reconcile expenses) may:

- Delay payment to the card provider.
- Result in temporary suspension of the card.
- Be escalated to the employee's manager and HR.

## Travel Upgrades and Loyalty Programs

### Upgrades

- Upgrades (first class, premium seats, hotel suites) are **not reimbursed** unless pre-approved.
- Employees may use personal points or miles to upgrade at their own cost.

### Loyalty Programs

- Employees may enroll in airline, hotel, or rental car loyalty programs.
- Personal benefit from points/miles earned on business travel is allowed.
- Loyalty status should not drive materially higher costs for Acme.

## Travel Insurance

- Acme provides **basic business travel insurance** for employees on approved trips.
- Additional personal travel insurance is at the employee's discretion and expense.

## Foreign Transactions

- Corporate cards may be used for foreign currency transactions.
- Foreign transaction fees are generally reimbursable for business expenses.
- Use local currency rather than "dynamic currency conversion" when possible to avoid higher fees.

## Cancellation and Change Fees

- Fees for changes or cancellations are reimbursable when due to business reasons.
- Fees resulting from personal decisions (e.g., changing a return date for vacation) are **not** reimbursable.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I withdraw cash from an ATM using my corporate card?**
A: Only if specifically authorized for a travel advance. Otherwise, ATM withdrawals are not allowed.

**Q: I accidentally used my corporate card for a personal purchase. What should I do?**
A: Notify Finance immediately. You will need to reimburse the company via payroll deduction or direct payment.

**Q: Do I earn personal rewards points on my corporate card?**
A: This depends on the card program. Regardless, business expenses must follow policy, not rewards optimization.
