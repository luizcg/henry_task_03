# Employee Reimbursements and Payroll Adjustments

This document explains how out-of-pocket reimbursements and payroll-related adjustments are handled at Acme Corporation.

## 1. Out-of-Pocket Reimbursements

Employees may occasionally need to pay for business expenses with personal funds (e.g., when a vendor does not accept the corporate card).

### 1.1 General Rules

- Out-of-pocket expenses must follow the same policies as corporate card charges.
- Receipts are required for all expenses above the local threshold.
- Reimbursement requests should be submitted within **30 days**.

### 1.2 Submission Process

1. Create a new expense report in the expense tool.
2. Mark payment method as **Personal / Out-of-Pocket**.
3. Attach receipts and provide clear descriptions.
4. Select the correct cost center and category.
5. Submit for manager approval.

### 1.3 Reimbursement Timing

- Approved reimbursements are typically paid in the **next payroll cycle** or via a separate payment run, depending on local practice.
- Delays may occur if documentation is incomplete or approvals are pending.

## 2. Payroll Adjustments

Sometimes, corrections or special payments must be processed through payroll.

### 2.1 Types of Adjustments

- **Retroactive pay** for salary changes that took effect in prior periods.
- **Bonus or commission true-ups**.
- **Corrections** for underpayments or overpayments.

### 2.2 Request and Approval

Payroll adjustments must be:

- Initiated by HR or the relevant manager.
- Approved by HR and Finance, depending on type and amount.
- Documented with supporting details (e.g., updated compensation letter).

### 2.3 Tax and Compliance Considerations

- Most payroll adjustments are considered taxable income and will be taxed according to local regulations.
- Non-cash benefits may have specific reporting and tax rules.

## 3. Reimbursement vs Payroll

Not all amounts owed to employees should go through payroll.

**Reimburse through expense system:**

- Travel and business expenses.
- Office supplies purchased personally.

**Process through payroll:**

- Compensation-related items (e.g., missed overtime, bonus corrections).
- Taxable benefits or allowances.

If in doubt, consult HR or Finance before submitting.

## 4. Negative Payroll Adjustments

In rare cases, corrections may result in a net amount **owed by the employee** (e.g., overpayment).

- Where permitted by law, adjustments may be made through payroll to recover the overpayment over time.
- Employees will be notified and asked to acknowledge the plan.

## 5. Terminated Employees

For employees leaving the company:

- Final pay may include unpaid reimbursements, unused PTO payouts (where applicable), and bonus or commission adjustments.
- The treatment of these items depends on local laws and company policy.

Finance, HR, and Payroll coordinate to ensure final payments are accurate and timely.

## 6. Getting Support

Employees with questions about reimbursements or adjustments should:

- Check the Finance and HR FAQs.
- Contact the Payroll team via the internal support channel.
- Speak with their manager or HR Business Partner for guidance.

Clear processes for reimbursements and payroll adjustments help ensure employees are treated fairly and that Acme remains compliant with legal and accounting requirements.
