# Budgeting and Approvals Guide - Acme Corporation Finance

## Overview

This guide explains how budgets are created, how spending is approved, and how managers can track financial performance against plan.

## Budget Cycle

Acme follows an annual budgeting process:

1. **Strategic Planning (Q3)** – Leadership defines company-level goals and investment priorities.
2. **Department Planning (Q4)** – Departments propose headcount, operating expenses, and capital expenditures.
3. **Review and Approval** – Finance and leadership review, adjust, and approve budgets.
4. **Execution (Next Year)** – Departments manage spending against approved budgets.

## Budget Ownership

- Each department has a **Budget Owner** (usually a director or VP).
- Budget Owners are responsible for:
  - Approving significant spend in their area.
  - Monitoring actuals vs. budget.
  - Identifying risks and opportunities.

## Spending Approvals

### Approval Thresholds

Spending approvals follow the Delegation of Authority (DOA) matrix. Example (illustrative only):

- Managers: up to $10,000
- Directors: up to $50,000
- VPs: up to $250,000
- C-Level: above $250,000

Actual thresholds are defined in the DOA document on the intranet.

### Pre-Approval

Pre-approval is required for:

- New headcount (FTE or contractors)
- Software purchases and renewals
- Marketing campaigns above a defined amount
- Travel for conferences or events above budgeted levels

## Tracking Spend

### Financial Dashboards

Managers can track their budgets via the **Finance Dashboard**:

- View actuals vs. budget by month and category.
- Drill down into transactions.
- Export data for analysis.

### Regular Reviews

Finance Business Partners (FBPs) meet with Budget Owners:

- Monthly or quarterly, depending on department.
- To review variances, forecasts, and upcoming needs.

## Forecasting

Throughout the year, departments may update forecasts:

- **Re-Forecasts** capture changes in expected revenue and costs.
- Updates help leadership make informed decisions about hiring, investments, and cost controls.

## Headcount Planning

- New headcount requests must align with budget and strategic priorities.
- Finance, HR, and department leaders review hiring plans regularly.

## Variances and Controls

### Positive Variances (Under Budget)

- May reflect efficiency or delayed spending.
- May be reallocated to other priorities with leadership approval.

### Negative Variances (Over Budget)

- Require explanation to Finance and leadership.
- May trigger cost-saving measures or reprioritization.
