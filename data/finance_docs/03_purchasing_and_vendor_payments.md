# Purchasing and Vendor Payments Guide - Acme Corporation Finance

## Overview

This guide explains how employees request purchases, onboard vendors, and ensure that invoices are paid on time.

## Purchasing Principles

- Consolidate purchases where possible to leverage pricing.
- Use preferred vendors when available.
- Obtain approvals before committing to significant spend.

## Purchase Request Process

1. Determine whether the purchase is **small** (under $1,000) or **large** (over $1,000) and whether a contract is involved.
2. For small purchases:
   - Use a corporate card or submit a purchase request via the Procurement Portal.
3. For larger purchases or contracts:
   - Submit a **Purchase Requisition (PR)**.

### Purchase Requisition (PR)

A PR should include:

- Description of the goods or services
- Estimated cost and currency
- Desired delivery date
- Vendor information (if known)
- Cost center or project to be charged

PRs are submitted via the **Procurement Portal** at **procure.acme-corp.com**.

## Vendor Onboarding

Before Acme can pay a vendor, the vendor must be onboarded into the system:

1. Submit a **Vendor Request** with basic information:
   - Legal name
   - Address
   - Contact information
   - Tax ID or VAT number (as applicable)
2. Vendor receives a secure link to upload:
   - W-9 or equivalent tax form
   - Banking details for ACH or wire payments

Finance and Legal will review vendor documentation for compliance.

## Purchase Orders (POs)

For larger purchases, a Purchase Order may be required:

- The PO is created by Procurement after PR approval.
- The PO number must be provided to the vendor.
- The vendor must reference the PO number on all invoices.

## Invoice Submission

Vendors can submit invoices via:

- Email: **invoices@acme-corp.com**
- Supplier portal (for integrated vendors)

All invoices must include:

- PO number (if applicable)
- Invoice number and date
- Vendor name and address
- Detailed description of goods/services
- Quantity, unit price, and total

## Invoice Approval and Payment

### Approval Workflow

1. Invoices are matched to POs or routed to the requester.
2. The requester verifies that goods/services were received and correct.
3. The invoice is coded to the correct cost center or project.
4. Approvals are captured in the AP system.

### Payment Terms

Standard payment terms are **Net 30** from the invoice date, unless otherwise agreed by contract.

Early payment discounts (e.g., 2%/10 Net 30) should be taken when cash flow permits.

## Payment Methods

Acme typically pays vendors via:

- ACH or electronic funds transfer (preferred)
- Wire transfer (for international or urgent payments)
- Check (for vendors unable to accept electronic payments)

## Handling Discrepancies

Common issues include:

- Invoice amount does not match the PO
- Incorrect tax or currency
- Duplicate invoices

If you notice an issue:

- Do not approve the invoice.
- Add comments in the AP system explaining the discrepancy.
- Contact the vendor and/or Procurement to resolve.

## Frequently Asked Questions

A: We cannot set up or pay vendors without required documentation.

**Q: How do I check the status of a vendor payment?**
