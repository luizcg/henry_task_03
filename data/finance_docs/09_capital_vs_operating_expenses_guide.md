# Capital vs Operating Expenses Guide

This guide explains the difference between capital expenditures (CapEx) and operating expenses (OpEx) at Acme Corporation and how to classify them correctly.

## 1. Definitions

### 1.1 Operating Expenses (OpEx)

Operating expenses are **day-to-day costs** required to run the business. Examples include:

- Salaries and wages.
- Rent and utilities.
- Software subscriptions (SaaS).
- Routine travel and training.
- Office supplies.

OpEx is fully expensed in the period it is incurred.

### 1.2 Capital Expenditures (CapEx)

Capital expenditures are **investments in long-term assets** that provide value over multiple years. Examples include:

- Servers, networking equipment, and data center hardware.
- Major software licenses with multi-year terms.
- Leasehold improvements.
- Large equipment purchases.

CapEx is capitalized and depreciated or amortized over time.

## 2. Why the Distinction Matters

Classifying expenses correctly affects:

- Reported profitability in each period.
- Key performance indicators (e.g., EBITDA).
- Compliance with accounting standards.

Incorrect classification can lead to:

- Misleading financial statements.
- Audit findings or restatements.

## 3. Common Scenarios

### 3.1 Hardware Purchases

**CapEx examples:**

- Purchase of server racks for a new data center.
- Network switches and firewalls with multi-year useful life.

**OpEx examples:**

- Monthly hosting fees paid to a cloud provider.
- Replacement of minor peripherals (mice, keyboards, cables).

### 3.2 Software and Licenses

**CapEx examples:**

- Perpetual software licenses with a useful life greater than one year.
- Significant implementation costs for enterprise systems.

**OpEx examples:**

- Monthly or annual SaaS subscriptions.
- Support and maintenance fees.

### 3.3 Improvements vs Repairs

**CapEx:**

- Major renovation of office space to add new meeting rooms.
- Structural improvements that extend asset lifespan.

**OpEx:**

- Routine repairs (e.g., fixing a broken light fixture).
- Minor maintenance activities.

## 4. Approval and Coding

When submitting a purchase request or invoice:

- Indicate whether you believe the expense is CapEx or OpEx.
- Provide sufficient description of the asset or service.

Finance will:

- Review high-value items for proper classification.
- Assign appropriate GL accounts and depreciation methods.

## 5. Thresholds

Acme may establish minimum thresholds for capitalization (e.g., $5,000 per asset or project).

- Purchases below the threshold are treated as OpEx.
- Purchases above the threshold may be treated as CapEx if they meet the useful life criteria.

Exact thresholds are documented in the internal accounting policy.

## 6. Project-Based Capitalization

In some cases, costs are accumulated in a project and capitalized together, such as:

- Building a new internal system.
- Implementing a major ERP or CRM platform.

These projects may include:

- Hardware.
- Software licenses.
- External consulting.
- Internal labor (in some jurisdictions).

Finance will work with project owners to track and capitalize eligible costs.

## 7. Getting Help

If you are unsure whether an expense is CapEx or OpEx:

- Include as much context as possible in the purchase request.
- Consult your Finance Business Partner.
- Refer to the detailed accounting policy for local rules.

Correct classification supports accurate reporting and compliance with accounting standards.
