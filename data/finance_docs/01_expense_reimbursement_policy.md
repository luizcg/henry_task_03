# Expense Reimbursement Policy - Acme Corporation Finance

## Purpose

This policy explains which business expenses are reimbursable, how to submit expense reports, and how reimbursements are processed. It works in conjunction with the Travel and Expense Policy maintained by HR.

## General Rules

- Expenses must be **business-related**, **reasonable**, and **properly documented**.
- Employees should choose cost-effective options that still allow them to work effectively.
- Expenses must be submitted **within 30 days** of the date incurred.

## Reimbursable Expenses

Examples of reimbursable expenses include:

- Business travel (transportation, lodging, meals) approved in advance
- Client entertainment when pre-approved and properly documented
- Registration fees for approved conferences, training, or events
- Reasonable internet or phone costs when required for remote work (per policy)

See the HR Travel and Expense Policy for more detailed travel guidelines.

## Non-Reimbursable Expenses

The following are **not** reimbursable:

- Personal entertainment or activities
- Fines or penalties (parking tickets, traffic violations)
- Alcohol not associated with a business meal
- Upgrades to luxury accommodations or premium services without approval
- Expenses for spouses, partners, or other family members (unless explicitly approved)

If you are unsure whether an expense is reimbursable, ask Finance before incurring the cost.

## Expense Submission Process

### Step 1: Collect Receipts

For each expense, you must retain an itemized receipt that shows:

- Date of the transaction
- Vendor name
- Description of goods or services
- Total amount and currency
- Proof of payment (e.g., "paid", last 4 digits of card)

### Step 2: Create Expense Report

1. Log into the Expense System at **expenses.acme-corp.com**.
2. Create a new **Expense Report**.
3. Enter a clear report name and business purpose (e.g., "Q3 Customer Visits – West Coast").

### Step 3: Add Expenses

For each expense line item:

- Select the correct **Date** and **Category** (Airfare, Hotel, Meals, Ground Transportation, etc.).
- Enter the **Amount** and **Currency**.
- Provide a short **Description** (e.g., "Dinner with client ABC – contract renewal discussion").
- Attach the **receipt image or PDF**.
- Assign the expense to the correct **Cost Center** or **Project Code**.

### Step 4: Submit for Approval

- Review your report for accuracy.
- Click **Submit**.
- Your direct manager will receive a notification to review and approve.

## Approvals

### Manager Responsibilities

Approving managers must:

- Confirm expenses are legitimate business expenses.
- Ensure the costs are reasonable and within policy limits.
- Verify that receipts and supporting documentation are attached.
- Return reports with issues to the employee for correction.

Some expense categories may require **additional approvals** (e.g., VP or Finance) based on amount thresholds.

## Deadlines and Cut-Offs

- Expense reports should be submitted **within 30 days** of the expense date.
- For year-end reporting, Finance may set an earlier deadline (typically first week of January) for prior year expenses.
- Delayed submission may result in **delayed or denied reimbursement**.

## Reimbursement Timing

Once an expense report is **fully approved**:

- Reimbursement is typically processed in the **next payroll cycle**.
- For employees paid monthly, reimbursements appear on the next monthly paycheck.
- For employees paid bi-weekly, reimbursements appear within **1–2 pay periods**.

Reimbursements are usually paid in the same currency as your salary. Currency conversions are handled by the payroll provider.

## Corporate Card vs. Personal Card

### Corporate Card Expenses

Employees with a corporate card should use it for most business expenses.

- Corporate card statements are paid **directly by Acme**.
- Cardholders must still code and reconcile transactions in the Expense System.
- Personal charges on corporate cards are prohibited. If accidental, they must be identified and repaid.

### Personal Card Expenses

If a corporate card is not available:

- Employees may use a personal card and request reimbursement via expense reports.
- Interest charges or late fees on personal cards are **not** reimbursable.

## Currency and Exchange Rates

When expenses are incurred in foreign currency:

- Enter the original currency and amount in the Expense System.
- The system will automatically apply the current exchange rate.
- If you paid in a different currency than the receipt (e.g., DCC at POS), explain in the description.

## Mileage Reimbursement

For business use of a personal vehicle:

- Use the **Mileage** category in the Expense System.
- Enter the number of miles driven (not fuel cost).
- The system will apply the current mileage rate (aligned with IRS or local standards).

Mileage should be supported by:

- A brief description of the trip (e.g., "Office to Client ABC – project review meeting").
- Start and end locations.

## Policy Exceptions

Occasional exceptions may be made for valid business reasons. To request an exception:

1. Explain the reason and context in the expense description.
2. Obtain written approval from your manager and, if required, your Finance Business Partner.

Finance reserves the right to **deny or adjust** expenses that significantly deviate from policy.

## Audits and Compliance

Finance may periodically audit expense reports to:

- Verify compliance with policy.
- Validate accuracy of coding and documentation.
- Identify potential fraud or misuse.

Employees must cooperate with audit requests and may be asked to provide additional documentation.

Serious or repeated violations may result in disciplinary action.

## Frequently Asked Questions
