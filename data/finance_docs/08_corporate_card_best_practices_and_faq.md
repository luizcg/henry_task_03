# Corporate Card Best Practices and FAQ

This guide provides best practices and frequently asked questions for using Acme Corporation's corporate credit cards.

## 1. Corporate Card Principles

The corporate card is a **business tool**, not a personal credit facility. Key principles:

- Use the card **only for legitimate business expenses**.
- Treat the card with the same care as a personal credit card.
- Submit receipts and expense reports on time.

Failure to follow these guidelines may result in card suspension or revocation.

## 2. Allowed and Prohibited Uses

### 2.1 Allowed Uses

- Airfare and train tickets for business travel.
- Hotels and lodging during approved trips.
- Meals with clients, partners, or colleagues for business purposes.
- Conference fees and professional development.
- Ground transportation (taxis, rideshare, public transit) for work travel.

### 2.2 Prohibited Uses

- Personal purchases, even if the employee intends to reimburse the company.
- Cash advances (unless explicitly authorized and documented).
- Alcohol not associated with a legitimate business meal.
- Family member expenses.
- Fines, penalties, or legal fees.

## 3. Receipt and Documentation Requirements

Cardholders must:

- Obtain **itemized receipts** for all transactions above the local threshold (e.g., $25).
- Attach receipts to the corresponding expense report line.
- Include a **clear business purpose** for each expense.

Examples of good business purpose descriptions:

- "Client dinner with ACME Retail to discuss Q3 renewal."
- "Taxi from office to customer site for implementation workshop."
- "AWS re:Invent conference registration for cloud architecture training."

## 4. Expense Submission and Deadlines

Timing expectations:

- Expenses should be submitted **within 10 business days** of the transaction or trip end.
- Monthly corporate card statements must be fully reconciled by the due date.

Late submissions may:

- Impact financial reporting.
- Lead to reminder notices from Finance.
- Result in temporary card suspension for repeat offenders.

## 5. Handling Mistakes and Personal Charges

If a personal charge is accidentally placed on the corporate card:

1. Notify your manager and the Finance team.
2. Include the charge on your expense report marked as **Personal - to be reimbursed**.
3. Repay the amount via payroll deduction or direct payment, depending on local process.

Repeated personal misuse may result in disciplinary action.

## 6. Lost or Stolen Cards

If your card is lost or stolen:

1. Contact the card issuer immediately to block the card.
2. Inform the Finance team and your manager.
3. Review recent transactions for any suspicious activity.

Fraudulent charges should be reported to both the issuer and Finance promptly.

## 7. Card Limits and Temporary Increases

Each card has a preset credit limit based on role and travel frequency.

To request a temporary limit increase:

1. Discuss the need with your manager.
2. Manager submits a request to Finance, including:
   - Reason for the increase.
   - Expected duration.
   - Estimated maximum spend.
3. Finance reviews and, if approved, coordinates with the card issuer.

Limit increases are temporary and will revert after the specified period.

## 8. Disputed Transactions

If you see a transaction that you do not recognize:

1. Verify that it is not related to a legitimate business purchase (e.g., vendor name mismatch).
2. If still unclear, contact the card issuer to dispute the charge.
3. Notify Finance of the dispute and expected resolution timeline.

Do not ignore suspicious charges; timely action is critical for successful resolution.

## 9. International Use and FX Fees

When using the corporate card abroad:

- Prefer local currency charges rather than dynamic currency conversion.
- Be aware of potential foreign transaction fees.
- Keep receipts in local currency; the expense system will convert automatically.

If frequent international travel is expected, Finance may:

- Provide cards with more favorable FX terms.
- Offer guidance on minimizing currency-related costs.

## 10. FAQs

### Q1: Can I use the corporate card for subscription services?

**A:** Yes, if the subscription is approved and related to your role. Ensure that:

- The subscription has gone through IT/security review if required.
- The correct cost center and approver are assigned.

### Q2: What happens if I leave the company with an outstanding balance?

**A:** Any unreconciled or personal charges may be deducted from final pay where legally permitted, or invoiced to you directly.

### Q3: Can I save my corporate card on personal devices or browsers?

**A:** Use caution when storing card details. Do not store card information on shared devices, and follow IT security guidelines.

### Q4: Can I use the card for small personal purchases and then reimburse the company?

**A:** No. Even if you intend to repay, personal use of the corporate card is prohibited.

Following corporate card best practices protects both employees and Acme, ensuring that business expenses are handled efficiently and transparently.
