# Travel Expense Scenarios and Examples

This document provides practical, scenario-based examples of how Acme Corporation's travel and expense policy applies in real situations. It is designed to complement the core policies by showing how to interpret rules in common edge cases.

## 1. Flights and Upgrades

### 1.1 Economy vs Premium Economy

Acme's standard policy is to book **economy class** for all business travel. Premium economy may be approved under specific circumstances.

**Allowed examples:**

- Long-haul flight exceeding 8 hours of continuous flight time, with manager approval in the travel request.
- Traveler has a documented medical condition requiring additional legroom, recorded with HR, and the travel approver has confirmed this in the request.

**Not allowed examples:**

- Upgrading to premium economy at the airport without pre-approval and then submitting the fare difference as an expense.
- Choosing premium economy for personal comfort on short-haul flights (less than 4 hours) and expecting reimbursement.

### 1.2 Business Class

Business class is **generally not reimbursable**. Exceptions require CFO or VP-level approval **before** booking.

**Typical non-reimbursable situations:**

- Traveler uses miles or points to upgrade and then attempts to expense the cash value of the upgrade.
- Traveler purchases a business class ticket when an economy ticket was reasonably available.

### 1.3 Change Fees and Cancellations

Change fees and cancellations related to business needs are usually reimbursable.

**Reimbursable:**

- Flight changed due to a last-minute customer meeting request.
- Trip canceled because of an internal re-prioritization communicated by management.

**Not reimbursable:**

- Traveler changes flight for personal convenience (e.g., staying extra days for tourism) without prior approval.
- Ticket is unused because the traveler did not review travel dates carefully.

## 2. Lodging Scenarios

### 2.1 Hotel Nightly Rate Above Guidelines

Acme provides guidance for maximum nightly rates by city or region. These amounts are **guidelines**, not hard caps, but significant overages must be explained and approved.

**Acceptable overage with justification:**

- Major conference week where hotels in the city are priced above normal ranges and only higher rates are available.
- Last-minute booking due to urgent travel request.

**Not acceptable:**

- Traveler books a luxury hotel when reasonably priced business hotels are available nearby.
- Traveler extends stay over a weekend for personal reasons and expects all nights to be covered.

### 2.2 Sharing Rooms

Acme does **not** require employees to share hotel rooms.

- Employees may choose to share rooms voluntarily, but each must still comply with cost guidelines.
- If employees choose to share, only the actual room cost can be expensed (no additional "theoretical" charge per person).

### 2.3 Airbnb and Alternative Lodging

The use of Airbnb or similar platforms may be allowed if:

- It is more cost-effective than hotels in the area.
- It complies with safety and security considerations.
- It is approved by the travel approver in advance.

Employees should avoid:

- Booking entire villas or large properties that significantly exceed what is needed for the trip.
- Using personal loyalty credits or vouchers and then expensing the equivalent cash value.

## 3. Meals and Per Diem

### 3.1 Daily Meal Limits

Acme may use either **actual expenses** or **per diem** depending on region and legal requirements. Employees must:

- Keep individual meal costs reasonable relative to local prices.
- Avoid consistently hitting the maximum limit without justification.

**Example of a reasonable day:**

- Breakfast: $12
- Lunch: $18
- Dinner: $35

**Example of potential issue:**

- Dinner: $90 with alcoholic drinks, no customer present, no approval.

### 3.2 Alcohol

Alcohol is reimbursable only under limited conditions:

- Reasonable amount as part of a business meal with customers or partners.
- Must not exceed local policy thresholds (e.g., no more than 1–2 drinks per person).

Non-reimbursable situations:

- Bar tabs after official events.
- Alcohol purchased for personal consumption in hotel rooms.

### 3.3 Group Meals

When one employee pays for a group meal:

- The expense should be submitted by that employee only.
- The attendee list should be included in the expense report.
- The business purpose should reference the meeting topic or customer name.

Splitting a single group bill into multiple expense reports for convenience is discouraged and may be rejected.

## 4. Ground Transportation

### 4.1 Taxis, Rideshare, and Public Transit

Employees should choose the most reasonable mode of transportation based on cost, safety, and time.

**Reimbursable:**

- Taxi or rideshare to/from airports, hotels, customer sites.
- Public transit tickets when practical and safe.

**Not reimbursable:**

- Luxury car services (e.g., limousines) unless justified by business need.
- Detours for personal errands.

### 4.2 Personal Vehicles

When using personal vehicles for business travel, Acme reimburses based on a **per-mile** rate.

Employees must:

- Track mileage accurately (start/end locations and distances).
- Exclude normal commuting miles.

Parking and tolls related to business travel are typically reimbursable with receipts.

## 5. Non-Reimbursable Examples

The following examples highlight common **non-reimbursable** items:

- Mini-bar charges for snacks and alcohol.
- In-room movies and streaming services.
- Personal grooming services (spa, salon, massages) not required for business.
- Fines (e.g., traffic or parking tickets).
- Costs for family members or friends traveling with the employee.

## 6. Mixed Personal and Business Travel

Employees sometimes combine business trips with personal travel. In such cases:

- Acme reimburses only the **business portion** of the trip.
- If adding personal days reduces the overall cost (e.g., cheaper airfare), this may be allowed but must be clearly documented.

Examples:

- Employee adds a personal weekend after a week of customer meetings. Company pays for weekday hotel nights and the portion of airfare equivalent to a standard business itinerary.
- Employee reroutes return flight to a personal destination. Company reimburses only the cost equivalent to returning directly home.

## 7. Documentation and Receipts

To ensure compliance and timely reimbursement:

- Receipts are required for expenses above the threshold defined in the main travel policy (e.g., $25 or equivalent).
- Credit card statements alone are not sufficient; itemized receipts are preferred.
- Each expense line should clearly state the business purpose.

## 8. Escalations and Exceptions

Employees should raise questions before incurring unusual expenses. When in doubt:

- Consult your manager or the Finance team before booking.
- Document any verbal approvals in the expense report comments.

Exception requests may be considered in cases such as:

- Travel disruptions due to weather or airline issues.
- Safety concerns requiring alternative arrangements.

Finance reserves the right to deny reimbursement for expenses that clearly violate policy or lack sufficient documentation.
